### Convo

Convo is a real-time chat application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), designed to make online conversations smooth and instant. It lets users create an account, log in, and chat with others in real time. The app is powered by Vite for fast builds, uses Socket.IO to handle real-time messaging, and relies on JWT for secure authentication. To keep the interface modern and user-friendly, Convo integrates Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for styling. The application is deployed on Render, making it easily accessible.  

With Convo, users can sign up with a unique username and password, log in securely, and start chatting right away. The real-time messaging feature ensures instant communication, creating a dynamic and engaging chat experience. Built with security in mind, JWT authentication helps keep user data safe. The interface is responsive, providing a smooth experience across different devices and screen sizes. Whether on a phone, tablet, or desktop, Convo delivers an easy-to-use and visually appealing chat platform.
